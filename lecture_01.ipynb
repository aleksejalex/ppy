    "1. Easy to learn: Python has a very simple and easy-to-read syntax, which makes it a great language for beginners to learn.\n",
    "2. Versatile: Python can be used for a wide range of tasks, including web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.\n",

    "4. Great for prototyping: Python is a great language for quickly prototyping ideas and experimenting with new concepts, as it has a short development cycle.\n",
    "5. Cross-platform: Python can run on many different operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, which makes it a great choice for cross-platform development.\n",
    "6. Rich Standard Library: Python comes with a rich standard library that includes modules for a variety of programming tasks, including connecting to web servers, reading and writing files, and working with data."

    "\n",
    "1. Performance: Python is an interpreted language, which can make it slower than compiled languages like C or C++. This can be a disadvantage for computationally intensive tasks.\n",
    "2. Dynamically Typed: Python is dynamically typed, which can make it more difficult to catch errors at compile-time and can lead to unexpected behavior at runtime.\n",
    "3. Memory Management: Python's memory management is not as efficient as other languages, which can make it less suitable for memory-intensive tasks.\n"

   },
   "source": [
    "4. Weak in Mobile Computing: Python is not a top choice for mobile computing, as it is not as well-suited for developing mobile applications as other languages such as Java.\n",
    "5. Design Restrictions: Python's design philosophy places an emphasis on readability and ease of use, but this can sometimes come at the expense of more advanced features that are available in other languages.\n",
    "6. Quality of open-source modules might be limited in some areas, eg. for statistics R can be a better choice.\n",

    "Overall, I am convinced that **Python is the best when you compare the time you spend learning it and options it gives you**."
