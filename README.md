# PPY 2023

Repository accompanying the 2023 Python course at the Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague.

## About the `zápočet`:

In general, you should work on your own project, where you will use Python and the concepts, modules, tricks, etc. which we have seen and practiced in the PPY course.

I am strongly recommending to choose your own topic and working on your ideas, rather than mine. But in the case of lack of inspiration, feel free to choose some of the assignments listed in this [shared Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10M3MUTEEs_V1aHFdBdM5cSRiccHATsY-ZrqkwuMawhg/edit). If you chose to do so, let me know and please wait for confirmation, so that every student has their own.

Feel free to use any resources you can find in our repository, on the internet, with your friends/family, etc. but be prepared to demonstrate that you understand what and why exactly you did, and also to creatively modify your solution to prove your solid knowledge and skills.

When you will feel ready to send over your work, do it via e-mail (or GitHub, if you prefer), and do not send only your code, but send also any comment/notebook/documentation you think would make my life easier to appreciate your high-quality effort :) But this is a great habit that will surely help you "sell" your work in the future. I am looking forward to seeing it. Good luck!

Deadline: two weeks before the end of "letný semestr", ie. 3.9.2023. But preferrably much sooner.
